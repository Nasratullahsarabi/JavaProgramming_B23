package name: day09_IfStatements

warmup tasks:
	1. write a program that can print out the maximum number between two different numbers
	        Ex:
	            num1 = 20;
	            num2 = 30;

            output:
	                30 is the maximum number

    2. write a program that can print out the minimum number between two numbers

        Ex:
            num1 = 20;
            num2 = 30;

            output:
                20 is the minimum number

    3. write a program that can find the number of days in a month (Assume that Feb has 28 days)
            Ex:
                month = 2

            output:
                    28 days

        Hints: it cannot be done with if&else statement, you will need single if statements
        28 days: 2
        30 days: 4, 6, 9, 11
        31 days: 1, 3, 5, 7,8,10, 12
